# IIT Bombay Chemical Inventory System
This project is part of the second-round assignment for the Javascript Web Programmer position at IIT Bombay. The goal of this project is to build a web page with a dynamic table that lists chemicals and their details. The user can sort, edit, and manipulate the data using basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap components.

## Project Overview

The web page displays a table that lists chemicals with their respective details like:

- Chemical ID
- Chemical Name
- Vendor
- Density
- Viscosity
- Packaging
- Pack Size
- Unit
- Quantity

The table supports sorting, editing, and manipulation of data rows, including features such as:

- Adding new rows
- Editing existing rows
- Moving rows up or down
- Deleting rows
- Refreshing and saving data
All functionality is implemented using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No external frameworks are used.

## Features
- Sortable Table: Click on any table header to sort the data in ascending or descending order.
- Editable Rows: Users can edit any row by clicking on a cell, which opens a form field to input new data.
- Add Row: Add new chemical details via a form and update the table.
- Move Rows: Move rows up or down to reorder chemicals.
- Delete Row: Easily delete unwanted rows.
- Refresh Data: Revert all changes and restore the original dataset.
- Save Data: Save the modified table data locally.
